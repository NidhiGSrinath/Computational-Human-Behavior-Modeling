<h1>The Influence of Auditory, Visual, and Textual Data on Choice-Based Decision Making</h1>
<h4>This project dives into the findings of two studies</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Mariadassou et al. (2021): The Effect of Auditory and Visual Recommendations on Choice</li>
  <li>Schroeder et al. (2017): The Humanizing Voice: Speech Reveals, and Text Conceals, a More Thoughtful Mind in the Midst of Disagreement</li>
</ul>

The results of the two studies referenced in this project share a similar conclusion that communication mediums have a significant impact on decision-making. Audio format of communication has been identified as having a more pronounced effect than other modes of communication. This intriguing result further aids in potential applications in various fields such as education, marketing, healthcare, etc.
<br> This project was carried out individually under the guidance of Dr. Doug Markant.
